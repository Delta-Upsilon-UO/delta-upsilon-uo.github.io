											<h2>The Experience of a Lifetime</h2>

										<p>Today reminded me of why I joined Delta Upsilon. It sounds so cliche, but it’s the absolute truth. After returning from our first day of work, I was frustrated at not being able to connect with the Jamaican workers on the job site. I am usually able to be someone people enjoy being around, whether as a result of my horribly dry sense of humor or me just making a fool out of myself in someway. But I was disheartened to come away from the first day without really getting to know those I was working alongside. I felt as if they were not all that trusting of me (for characteristically understandable reasons) and that they were frustrated at my rate of learning. It seemed as though they were never able to leave a task for completion solely by myself because they were unsure of my abilities and didn’t want to have to spend time just to do it over again. Ya know, the whole ‘I’ll just take care of it myself’ attitude that we all have. So in that regard, I came away somewhat disappointed with the circumstances of the first day.</p>

										<p>However, today reversed my feelings entirely. The morning started off as previously noted, but improved steadily throughout the day until my breakthrough moment, so to speak. I had been working all day with the project’s director, Paul, who speaks a rough mix of predominantly French and Spanish slang, and a splash of mostly undetectable English. The language barrier was real. And I felt like a nuisance asking so many questions, and repeating them so many times. He showed me one million ways to pull nails out if boards and one million ways to render cement onto a wall and one million ways how to answer one million questions. And that really hit home. As much as I would’ve expected him to be flustered with my lack of construction knowledge, he wasn’t. He remained calm and not only willing, but eager to show me the right way to do something. And then I looked around and realized that’s how all of the Jamaicans I could observe were acting. Everyone was eager to help and gift to you their knowledge, because it made for a more productive environment. The US could certainly take a page from Paul; at long last I had gained his trust. We had been working on building a wooden window frame, from sawing to nailing to fitting, and he guided me through the early steps. But the he said he wanted water and would be right back. He never returned. A brother and I finished the remaining window frame by ourselves before he finally showed up again. He walked over to take a look and said “Right on ‘mon. Way to go!” in his complex dialect. I saw pride in his eyes and it made me proud of myself and my brothers for the work we’d completed. And I thought, why can’t everyone be looking to others better? Why can’t society work toward that goal? What are we (in the US) missing? And I answered my question as soon as I thought it up. Our country is missing more opportunities like the one provided by Delta Upsilon through GSI. It truly combines humility with knowledge through the use of service to accomplish a needed task. And if you’re wondering what it is you’ll be missing if you don’t attempt to experience GSI, I’ll tell you now. It’s the experience of a lifetime.</P>

										<p>I kind of spoke to this in my video interview today when I said, “If you’re looking to change your life, don’t come. Come to Jamaica because you see a project that needs to be completed, and the experience will change your life.”  I said that because I want people to know that you don’t step foot on a beach, drink a beer, and build a lunchroom to change your life. You get to know people like Paul and embrace the knowledge they are eager to share with you, looking up to see the children smile at what you’ve both accomplished, and think to yourself, this is what life should be like. This is why I am where I am.</P>
