										<p>The Williams campus, in the rugged hills of northwestern Massachusetts, was Spartan. Men lived in barely heated halls, doing the necessary chores themselves. There were no women students on campus. Life focused on knowledge and discourse, religion, and family. There were no radios or televisions; the electric light nor the phonograph had been invented. Even the telegraph Morse code transmitted by wire - was years away.</p><div><br /></div><div>There were neither trains nor paved roads; the efficient use
 of internal combustion and "horseless carriages" was a good 60 years in
 the future. The nearest "large" cities, Troy and Schenectady across the
 New York border, together sheltered only 20,000. The Union had about 
14.5 million citizens and slaves in 24 states. Andrew Jackson was 
President and Abraham Lincoln was a young man of twenty five. Canada was
 firmly under British domination. The modern world as we know it today 
lay undiscovered and barely dreamed. </div><div><br />Consider those men who founded Delta Upsilon at Williams College, on a
 crisp November day in 1834. What do they have in common with you? Why 
has their inspiration thrived for more than 175 years? What role will 
their principles play in your life? What is the import of a non-secret 
fraternity based on the Promotion of Friendship, the Development of 
Character, the Diffusion of Liberal Culture and the Advancement of 
Justice? 
<br /><b><br /></b><br /><b>A Premise of Fairness</b> 
<br />In the fall of 1834, there arose on the Williams College campus a 
matter of great concern to the faculty - and to many students as well. 
The focus of their debate fell on the two secret fraternities on campus;
 not on their presence, but on their activities. These two societies had
 conspired to make use of an advantage. Their members, like all men at 
Williams, wanted to fare admirably in the race for campus honors. 
However, by use of their secrecy, they had strayed from their earlier, 
legitimate mission as debating and literary societies, and had become 
political machines. Their goal was to place their members into high 
campus offices, whether qualified or not. They had done this 
effectively. </div><div> 
<br />Faculty members frowned on this trend. It raised previously 
unheard-of distinctions, jealousies, and animosity where none was 
needed. They questioned whether the emphasis on campus politics was 
contrary to the fundamental purposes of the college itself. Does this 
sound familiar? It may be that some faculty on your campus ask whether 
the activities of fraternities add to or detract from your college or 
university. Some students felt the same way. Their sense of justice was 
offended; they disliked the practice of conferring honors without merit.
 They longed for an even playing field. They were convinced that the 
spoils of victory should go to men on merit, men who truly earned their 
rewards, and not to unqualified men who used political clout to deliver 
them the prize. 
<br /><b><br /></b><br /><b>DU's First Meeting</b> 
<br />So it was that 20 men from the sophomore and junior classes met to 
forge a plan of action. They quickly found ten of the best men from the 
freshman class, and called a meeting for the evening of November 4. 
Though we would love to know exactly what happened that evening, we 
cannot; a fire destroyed all the Williams records seven years later. But
 we know that these 30 men gathered in the Freshman Recitation Room of 
Old West College, a building that stands today. 
<br /><br />They chose a name: The Social Fraternity. "Social" didn't mean 
entertainment events, as many fraternity men mistakenly believe today. 
Instead, it was much broader. It meant an interest in life's 
interactions among people, and how society would better itself through 
group action. 
<br /><br />The secret societies ridiculed the new group, but they knew full well
 that the Social Fraternity would thrive. And did it ever! Because its 
aims matched those of the college, the Social Fraternity soon had more 
than half the men on campus in its ranks - and soon, the first DUs 
dominated the lists of campus honors. This good idea of a spirited 
brotherhood based on merit spread rapidly. Within four years, men of 
similar beliefs set up another group, at Union College in Schenectady. 
Our Middlebury Chapter was born in 1845; Hamilton, in 1847. More 
followed: Amherst, Western Reserve, Wesleyan, Vermont, Rochester and 
Colby. These early groups thrived, powered by their zeal in battling the
 abuses of secret societies. These seven chapters at the 1852 Convention
 of the Anti-Secret Confederation came to be known as the "Seven Stars" 
of the anti-secrecy fight. Thus, they are commemorated in our Coat of 
Arms, in the Seven Stars you see below the open helmet, for non-secrecy 
and friendship, and above the balanced scales, for Justice. 
<br /><br />An early meeting of four chapters brought these anti-secret groups 
into an organized fraternity. It was in Troy, N.Y., in November 1847. 
Williams, Union, Amherst and Hamilton met in Convention, and formally 
established the Anti-Secret Confederation (ASC). Its Constitution 
paralleled that of Williams, and the Convention first adopted a member 
key, bearing the Greek words Ouden Adelon, "Nothing Secret." The 
Fraternity's colors were set as "old gold on a field of sky-blue." 
<br /><br />While other early fraternities fiddled with secret grips and 
recognition signs, DU was promoting friendship and developing character.
 While the secret fraternities wasted energy guarding their precious 
secrets from others, DU fought to advance justice and spread liberal, 
learned culture. DU had no need for mystic principles shrouded in secret
 ritual. Our aims were open, honest and direct.
