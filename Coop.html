										<p>Coming to the worksite in Jamaica I wasn’t sure what to expect. But getting to the the school I was pleasantly surprised that we had a few hired workers who knew what they were doing to show us American college kids what to do. A lot of the time I was working along a side a guy named Shavon. There was definitely a language barrier and it was often difficult to communicate what he wanted me to do. Despite that, he never really gave up on us, or me, on doing some of the work that he was much better at than us. I later found out he was just 18 years old and didn’t even go on to high school. It was surprising because he was so good at what he did and he was a great teacher.</P>

										<p>On the second day of work I noticed he opened up a bit more. He came to work as was playing music off his phone and was much more relaxed and seemed to be having more fun. Working along side of him I noticed he played a lot of the same music I liked and listened to back home. He was showing me a lot of the songs he played and tried to tell me a little about them. And I would do the same for the music I listened to.</P>

										<p>Later in the day all of the clothes and hats were given to the kids of the school, the teachers, principal, and the workers as well. A few of the workers got hats that I had brought from home. I gave one to Shavon. It was a Pittsburgh Pirates hat. He seemed to really like it as he was posing and taking pictures with it on. We were hanging out and one of the DU brothers was joking around with him and said something like, “oh too bad the Pirates are bad.” Shavon looked at him and said, “hey, my friend gave this hat to me.” I looked at him surprised and smiled. It was a very cool moment that he had called me his friend, just from working and hanging out with him for two days. Despite the language barrier, the different socioeconomic backgrounds, and the fact that he was better than me at what we were working on, we still bonded. And that is a truly awesome thing in my mind.</P>
