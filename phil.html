											<h2>Philanthropy</h2>
											<h3>Global Service Initiative</h3>
										</header>
										<p>GSI is unique and Delta Upsilon is proud to have developed this initiative. It serves a dual role in that it is not only the international philanthropy, but also the international service of the Fraternity.  DU developed GSI because we realized it was important for the fraternity to create experiences that prepare men for success in a new global environment.  Developing global awareness and cultural competencies through our work is of significant importance.  The idea for GSI came from a challenge from the board.  It was then presented to the fraternity at the Leadership Institute in 2009 and the UGAB voted to approve GSI as the official philanthropy and service of DU.  We choose to create this experience in Jamaica because we have the relationships necessary to work with the local government, to connect with local schools and to engage with the local culture.  We also have a domestic component through our Washington D.C. trips.  Philanthropy events such as chili dinners, car shows, bowl-a-thons and haunted houses raise money for various GSI needs.   These needs include items like building materials, cement, lumber, and tools to do the work we do.  DU chapters collectively raise and donate approximately $100,000 to the GSI each academic year.  Additionally, DU members travel to GSI sites in Jamaica and Washington D.C. throughout the country and overseas to serve as positive male role models. Hundreds of men volunteer as cabin counselors, activity specialists, unit leaders, and other camp staff during a week or summer as a camp counselor. </P>
										<p>The Delta Upsilon Global Service Initiative (GSI) offers members a unique opportunity to engage in direct service in developing nations and in the United States while uniting their actions with the Principles of the Fraternity.  The GSI service-immersion trip for our members is a seven-day experience to Jamaica and Washington, D.C. with brothers from across the country.  For an entire week, brothers will be engaged in direct, hands-on service.  Additionally, each day will include evening reflection designed to help participants explore how they have been impacted and influenced by their experience as well as conversation regarding the Four Founding Principles.  Our experience in Jamaica will center on the construction of a dining hall addition to an area school.  In Washington, D.C. there will be an opportunity to work with a local agency that's mission is to eradicate poverty.  Regardless of what experience you choose, we will work together to explore a new culture, put our values into action, and build connections that will last a lifetime.</P>
